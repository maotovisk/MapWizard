# Hitsound Copier

A tool that aims to replicate the hitsounds of a beatmap difficulty to other difficulties on the set. It is useful to avoid the inconvenience of having to redo the same hitsound logic for many difficulties across the set.

## Project Goals

- Fully cross-platform;
- Replicate hitsounds from a difficulty to other beatmaps;
- Metadata manager funcionality;
- Map cleaner funcionality.

## Requirements

- .NET SDK 8.0

## Usage

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maotovisk/HitsoundCopier.git
```

2. Run the project

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Current Status

- Developing a new beatmap (.osu file) parser

## Roadmap

- Implement the basic beatmap parser
- Implement the hitsound copier
- Implement the metadata manager
- Implement the map cleaner
